And it’s petrifying.",
      "searchResults": "The claim that the **left glorifies death—especially of adversaries—and the right does not** is not supported by credible evidence or contemporary political analysis from recent sources.\n\nResearch and expert commentary show that both political sides in the US express serious polarization and hostility, with some Democrats and Republicans endorsing violence or even political killings under extreme beliefs, though generally politicians on both sides officially reject such violence[3]. Moreover, the idea that one side glorifies death politically while the other does not is not substantiated by studies; rather, both sides participate in a deeply polarized environment with incidents of extremism and violence on all sides[3].\n\nThere is also evidence of differences in mortality and health outcomes along political lines. Counties that vote Democratic have experienced greater improvements in death rates over the past two decades compared to Republican-leaning counties, and Republican areas tend to have worse health outcomes and higher death rates from causes including COVID-19, heart disease, and suicide[2][4]. This reflects disparities in health policy and risk mitigation behaviors rather than any glorification of death.\n\nStudies analyzing mortality risk by political ideology and affiliation have found conservatives and moderates to have slightly higher risks compared to liberals, which is tied to sociodemographic and behavioral factors, not political values regarding death glorification[5].\n\nRegarding political violence, polls find low but present percentages of both Democrats and Republicans who find political violence somewhat justified, showing that both sides carry risks of escalated hostility and normalization of violence[3][6]. The significant political polarization and dehumanization of the “other side” contribute to this dangerous climate but do not demonstrate that the left uniquely glorifies death.\n\nIn sum, the proposition that the left glorifies death of adversaries more than the right does not align with researched political and social analysis. Instead, the US political climate features toxic polarization, mutual dehumanization, and isolated extremist views on both sides, with health disparities linked to political environments but not a fundamental glorification of death by either side[1][3][6].",

This assassination shocked the US and generated a surge of political hatred, with Kirk being a key cultural and ideological conservative influencer closely aligned with Donald Trump[5].\n\nPrior to the assassination, MAGA supporters had been strongly hostile toward liberals, but this event has caused shock within their own ranks. Kirk had been a central figure who galvanized young conservative activists and was known for his anti-woke, anti-abortion, and strongly right-wing messages[5]. The assassination prompted widespread condemnation, including from Republican leaders such as House Speaker Mike Johnson, who called for civil discourse despite the heated political climate[5].\n\nThus, the recent wave of MAGA hostility aimed at liberals was dramatically complicated by this internal tragedy involving one of their own top figures[5].",

      "searchResults": "The claim that **Tyler Robinson** is “Charlie Kirk’s killer,” is **accurate and confirmed by multiple major news outlets**. Tyler Robinson, age 22, from Utah, was identified and arrested in connection with the shooting and killing of Charlie Kirk at a Utah university campus event. This was reported by **ABC News**[2], **FOX News**[3], and **NBC News**[5], all of which confirm his identity, age, and Utah residence.\n\nHowever, regarding the **details in the \"bio\"**:\n\n- **Pro gun**: None of the reputable news sources in the search results mention Robinson being “pro gun.” Coverage only confirms that he used a firearm in the crime and had proficiency with a rifle[2][3]. There is mention of a high-powered rifle and familiarity with firearms, but this does **not confirm his political stance on gun rights**.\n- **Conservative family**: No evidence in the available coverage confirms that Robinson “comes from a conservative family.” In fact, one family member is quoted as saying Robinson “had become more political in recent years” and had expressed a “dislike of Kirk,” but there is no information about the family’s political affiliation[3]. \n- **Dressed as Trump for Halloween**: The **photo you provided** appears to show a man in a costume involving a caricature or figure of Donald Trump, which visually supports the claim that Robinson once dressed as Trump (or used a Trump prop) for Halloween. However, **mainstream news outlets do not reference this photo** in their reporting. I cannot independently verify that the person in the photo is definitely Tyler Robinson based on available news coverage, though the image fits the description provided in your query.\n\n**Summary of fact-check based on news sources:**\n- Tyler Robinson is confirmed as the suspect in Charlie Kirk’s killing, age 22, and from Utah[2][3][5].\n- No credible news coverage found indicating he is “pro gun” or from a “conservative family.”\n- The Halloween costume claim is visually plausible via your photo, **but not independently confirmed by news sources**.\n\nFor specific claims about Robinson’s political views or family, there is **no supporting evidence in the major reports** covering his arrest and background. The only personal political information noted is that he had grown more political and expressed dislike of Charlie Kirk in the years leading up to the shooting[3].",

      "searchResults": "The claim that Donald Trump spent a week trying to get Kamala Harris assassinated by pulling her Secret Service detail and using the LAPD police union to pull her additional security detail is not supported by available evidence.\n\nIt is factual that **Trump revoked Kamala Harris’ extended Secret Service protection** in late August 2025, ending the federal protection she had been granted beyond the typical six months after leaving office[1][3][7]. This action was within presidential authority; vice presidents typically receive Secret Service protection for six months, and Biden had extended Harris' protection to 18 months before leaving office, which Trump rescinded[1][7].\n\nFollowing the revocation of federal protection, the **Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) temporarily provided security for Kamala Harris**, using specialized Metropolitan Division officers to fill the gap[1][3][5]. However, this LAPD protection was **short-lived due to internal backlash and criticism from the LAPD union (Los Angeles Police Protective League), which opposed diverting officers from regular duties** and called the arrangement \"nuts,\" eventually prompting the LAPD to stop providing her protection[4][5].\n\nAfter the LAPD ended its protection, the California Highway Patrol stepped in to provide security assistance for Harris[5]. There is no credible evidence or official report linking these protective detail changes to any attempt or plan to facilitate an assassination, nor is there evidence that Trump orchestrated the police union's actions. The LAPD union independently opposed the extra duty based on resource allocation and taxpayer concerns[4][5].\n\nIn summary:\n- Trump legally revoked Harris's extended Secret Service protection after the typical six-month period[1][3][7].\n- LAPD provided temporary protection but withdrew after union pushback[4][5].\n- The California Highway Patrol then provided protection[5].\n- No credible information supports that Trump or anyone else sought to \"get Kamala Harris assassinated\" by these actions or through the police union.\n\nThus, while the changes in Harris’s security details and the union backlash are documented facts, framing these events as an assassination attempt or deliberate effort by Trump to endanger Harris lacks factual support and appears to be a mischaracterization or exaggeration.",

Some surveys estimate overall excess deaths (including indirect causes) around 650,000, but these numbers remain disputed and far below 4 million[3][4].\n\n- Other research finds civilian deaths in Iraq between 60,000 and 110,000 for certain periods, with peak annual civilian deaths at about 29,500 in 2006[1][2].\n\n- Death tolls across the entire Middle East and West Asia from conflicts post-9/11 (including Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen, etc.) are significant but do not reliably add to 4 million innocent deaths in a verifiable way. Estimates for these multiple conflicts combined range in the hundreds of thousands to over a million but lack conclusive and universally accepted figures.\n\nSimilarly, millions displaced and countries destabilized are well documented consequences of war and related interventions in the region, consistent with the quoted mourning statement.\n\nTherefore, while the loss of life and displacement resulting from U.S. interventions and ensuing conflicts are tragic and significant, **the specific figure of 4 million+ innocent people killed in Iraq and adjacent regions is an overestimate not supported by the most credible casualty databases and epidemiological studies available**[1][2][3][4][5].",

      "searchResults": "The claim that the U.S. sent \"$100 billion to the Ayatollah\" references the sanctions relief and frozen Iranian assets that were released or unfrozen after the 2015 Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA). The JCPOA led to the lifting of some sanctions and the release of approximately $100 billion in frozen Iranian funds and assets, but this money was primarily Iranian government assets that had been frozen internationally — not a direct payment from the U.S. to Iran. The value includes oil revenues and other frozen assets across various countries, not solely U.S. funds[1][3][5].\n\nRegarding the claim that \"he advocated stoning gays to death\": There is no solid, credible evidence that any recent Iranian leader or official explicitly advocated stoning homosexuals. Iran’s Islamic Penal Code does prescribe severe punishments for homosexuality, including the death penalty, which is consistent with the regime’s known harsh treatment of LGBTQ+ individuals. However, the specific claim that an individual \"advocated stoning gays to death\" requires verification of who exactly \"he\" is, and whether that statement is an accurate direct quote or a mischaracterization.\n\nOn the broader issue of Iran’s policies towards LGBTQ+ people, it is documented that Iran criminalizes homosexuality, with punishments including the death penalty in some cases, typically by hanging rather than stoning. Stoning is prescribed in Iran for certain other crimes, like adultery, under the Islamic Penal Code. The regime’s human rights record on LGBTQ+ issues is severe and widely condemned internationally.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- The \"$100 billion sent to the Ayatollah\" refers to the release of Iranian frozen assets and sanctions relief primarily resulting from the JCPOA, not a direct payment or gift from the U.S. to Iran[1][3][5].\n- Iran has a documented history of harsh penalties for homosexuality, including execution, but the claim that any Iranian official specifically *advocated stoning homosexuals to death* lacks verified sourcing based on publicly available information[1][2].\n- Iran’s regime routinely enforces severe legal penalties against LGBTQ+ individuals, including death penalties, consistent with its strict Islamic laws[1][4].\n\nTherefore, the accusation that \"he advocated stoning gays to death\" should be investigated carefully for accuracy and context, while the \"$100 billion\" claim relates to the complex issue of frozen Iranian assets and sanctions relief linked to the nuclear deal.",

The 9/11 attacks were conducted by the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda, led by Osama bin Laden. No reputable evidence has ever been presented linking the state of Israel or its government to planning, supporting, or carrying out the attacks[1][2][3].\n\n- Official government investigations, including the 9/11 Commission Report, found **no evidence of Israeli involvement** in the attacks.\n- Claims about Israeli intelligence (Mossad) being involved or Israelis being seen celebrating on 9/11 have been widely debunked[2].\n- These conspiracy theories often recycle **anti-Semitic tropes** and have been denounced by fact-checking organizations and credible news outlets[3].\n\n### 2. **Claim: \"Israel killed Charlie Kirk\"**\n\nAs of the current date, **Charlie Kirk, a conservative commentator and founder of Turning Point USA, is alive**. There are **no verified reports** or credible news sources that state Charlie Kirk has died, let alone that Israel or anyone else was responsible.\n\n- This part of the image is likely a fabricated claim. There are no public news reports or statements supporting this assertion.\n- Spreading such misinformation can cause harm and confusion, and there is no factual basis for it.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth claims in the image are unfounded conspiracy theories. The **9/11 attack** was committed by al-Qaeda, **not Israel**, according to all credible evidence and official investigations[1][2][3]. The claim about **Charlie Kirk** is completely false; he is alive as of the latest available information.\n\n---\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_conspiracy_theories  \n[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks_advance-knowledge_conspiracy_theories  \n[3]: https://www.cfr.org/blog/seven-resources-debunking-911-conspiracy-theories",

The FBI has publicly requested help in identifying a person of interest, but their statements do not confirm the identity circulating on social media[3][4][5].\n\n- **Social media speculation:** The theory that Skye Valadez is the suspect originates from social media users and amateur sleuths, who have compared images released by the FBI with photos from protest events and Valadez’s alleged social media profiles. Multiple sources note this is currently *speculation, not established fact*[1][3][4][6].\n\n- **Potential misidentification:** Reports indicate there is confusion over the identities, with some rumors suggesting the argument with Charlie Kirk involved someone else entirely, possibly another individual who transitioned gender or belonged to Kirk’s broader activist opposition[1][3].\n\n- **No verifiable evidence of gun group affiliation:** While there is discussion of Valadez’s alleged anti-conservative political activity and possible interest in firearms (citing Pinterest boards, music tracks, etc.), no **direct evidence** has been documented linking Valadez to a specific “Trans Activist gun group”[4].\n\n- **Ongoing investigation:** The FBI has not released the name or confirmed the identity of the shooter as of the search results’ latest date. Media outlets advise waiting for official updates[4][5].\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe suggestion that Skye Valadez has been “publicly identified” as the shooter is not supported by official sources; this identification is *unverified speculation* spread on social media[3][4][6]. There is also no substantiated evidence directly connecting Valadez to a trans activist gun group[4]. Law enforcement has not confirmed these claims, and the investigation is ongoing.",

Lauren Boebert requested a prayer be said out loud, which triggered shouting from Democrats.\n- Democrats reportedly shouted about Republicans ignoring a school shooting on the same day.\n- Republicans responded with accusations directed at Democrats.\n- Speaker Mike Johnson repeatedly tried to quell the shouting, calling for order and unity[1][2][3].\n\nThus, while there was jeering and heckling in Congress related to Charlie Kirk's death, this occurred in a context of partisan conflict rather than a broad or mainstream celebration of his death as a political position.

      "searchResults": "On August 7, 2025, Rahul Gandhi, the Leader of the Opposition, held a press conference alleging large-scale vote theft and manipulation of electoral rolls, particularly highlighting issues in Karnataka’s Mahadevapura assembly segment and accusing the Election Commission of India (ECI) of complicity. This event sparked widespread national debate and was prominently amplified by several social media influencers[1][3].\n\nFollowing the press conference, the Election Commission issued notices to Rahul Gandhi, demanding evidence to substantiate his claims of voter fraud, including allegations of specific instances like a voter purportedly voting twice. The ECI sought these documents from Gandhi to initiate inquiries[4]. Meanwhile, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court seeking the formation of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe these allegations, citing Gandhi’s August 7 press conference as foundational evidence[5].\n\nInvestigations by others, including the BJP, pointed to metadata of documents released by Gandhi that suggested foreign involvement in scripting the vote theft narrative, based on digital metadata indicating creation in Myanmar time zone—thus accusing Gandhi of allowing foreign interference in the campaign[2]. Gandhi and Congress had not officially responded to these specific metadata allegations as of the latest reports.\n\nIn summary, Rahul Gandhi’s August 7 press conference on alleged vote theft triggered wide political and judicial reactions, social media amplification, Election Commission scrutiny, as well as counter-allegations of foreign involvement in shaping the narrative[1][2][3][4][5].",

Law enforcement has **not confirmed** the identity of the person in the FBI’s photos and has specifically asked the public for tips rather than announcing a suspect[1][2].\n\n#### 2. **\"SoundCloud track uploaded a month ago titled 'Charlie Kirk Dead at 31' and deleted\"**\n- **Support**: There is **widespread reporting that users have found and widely shared screenshots** of a SoundCloud track titled **\"Charlie Kirk Dead at 31\"** linked to a profile alleged to be Skye Valadez’s. This track reportedly appeared online weeks before the shooting and was deleted shortly after, but screenshots remain[1][2].\n- **Contradiction / Limitation**: These claims are **based on screenshots circulating on social media**. There is **no official confirmation that Skye Valadez created the track, nor that the timing of upload and deletion is connected to the event**[1][2].\n\n#### 3. **\"Changed his location to 'leave me alone'\"**\n- **Support**: News sources report that online sleuths observed Valadez’s Facebook location was changed from Salt Lake City to a cryptic message (\"leave me alone\") after the identity speculation began[1].\n\n#### 4. **Link to the shooting or being officially suspect?**\n- **Refutation/Context**: No law enforcement or official source has named Skye Valadez as a suspect, nor confirmed any connection between the social media findings and the shooting. The **online identification remains unsubstantiated rumor**; the FBI continues to keep investigation details private and is still seeking the public's help[1][2][3].\n\n### About the Images You Provided:\n- **They appear to show screenshots of the SoundCloud track, images allegedly of Skye Valadez, Pinterest search results, and speculative side-by-side photos** — all of which have circulated widely in online forums and on social media.\n- **None of these images, nor the accompanying commentary, constitute official confirmation or reliable evidence.** Their origin (e.g., 4chan, Facebook, Pinterest) further emphasizes that this is an online rumor at this point, not confirmed fact[1][2].\n\n### Law Enforcement/Official Source Status\n- **The FBI has not released any names.** They are asking the public for tips to identify the person in the released security images.[1][2][3]\n- **No evidence has been officially presented linking Skye Valadez to the crime beyond unverified internet speculation.**\n\n### Final Note:\nThe post accurately summarizes **what is being spread online**, including the SoundCloud track and the change in location. *But, as of now, all these claims are based on unverified social media reports, and none have been corroborated by official investigations or news outlets.* The FBI continues to withhold suspect identification and has not named Skye Valadez as a suspect or person of interest[1][2][3].\n\n**Sources:**\n- [IndiaTimes: Who is Skye Valadez?](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/who-is-skye-valadez-internet-identifies-new-alleged-suspect-in-charlie-kirk-shooting-after-fbi-releases-photos-of-person-of-interest-669909.html)[1]\n- [IndiaTimes: FBI shares POI photos, online speculations](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/fbi-shares-photos-of-person-of-interest-in-charlie-kirk-shooting-after-omar-najra-galvz-skye-valadez-linked-to-the-case-online-669900.html)[2]\n- [YouTube: JLR Investigates, \"Shooter Spotted!\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmhfkKdQylM)[3]",

President Trump and some MAGA personalities linked the shooting to political rhetoric but did not suggest any celebration from Democrats[1][3].\n\n- Social media and public comments include some expressions of anger and disdain towards Kirk’s views from critics, but there is strong disapproval of political violence itself across major platforms. Some users have noted online expressions purportedly celebrating Kirk’s death, but these appear to be fringe individuals rather than organized or mainstream Democratic responses. Platforms like Bluesky issued warnings against celebrating the assassination[4].\n\n- Analysis from former FBI officials describes the shooting as a political assassination, contributing to concern over rising political violence in the U.S. There is no information suggesting any official Democratic Party endorsement or celebration of the incident[5].\n\nIn summary, while political tensions run high, authoritative sources do not support the claim that Democrats are publicly celebrating Charlie Kirk’s assassination; rather, the prevalent public and political response is condemnation of the violence regardless of political affiliation.",

      "searchResults": "The claim that \"Hours have gone by since Charlie Kirk’s assassination and not a peep on this platform from the Democrats’ golden boy, James Talarico\" is not supported by the available information from recent coverage and statements.\n\nCharlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, was fatally shot on September 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University during a speaking event[1][2][4]. This assassination has received widespread media attention, official condemnations from officials across the political spectrum, and sparked concern about rising politically motivated violence in the U.S.[3][5].\n\nThere is no publicly available evidence or authoritative reporting that James Talarico, a Texas Democratic politician, has or has not spoken specifically on this platform or Twitter about the assassination hours after it occurred. The quoted tweet that criticizes the national Democratic Party for \"forgetting how to fight\" and calling for a \"Democratic Party that’s a little less Washington and a little more Texas\" appears to be a general political statement rather than a direct response to Kirk's assassination. This tweet does not mention Kirk or the shooting incident, and its linked content is generic about party strategy rather than current events[quoted tweet].\n\nMultiple prominent Democratic figures have condemned political violence recently (e.g., responses to attacks on Minnesota lawmakers and other incidents noted in the sources)[5]. The silence or activity of a single individual, including James Talarico, does not provide sufficient basis to characterize his stance or values definitively.\n\nIn summary:\n- Charlie Kirk was assassinated on Sept 10, 2025, confirmed by FBI and media[1][2][4].\n- Political leaders and parties have publicly condemned political violence broadly[3][5].\n- The cited tweet by James Talarico or the phrase \"Democrats' golden boy\" does not show any direct KC Kirk-related commentary or ignore the event.\n- Without direct evidence or specific statements from Talarico on this exact event, the claim that he has been silent to signify defecting loyalty or character is unsubstantiated.\n\nTherefore, the implication that James Talarico's silence \"tells you all you need to know about who he is\" is an opinion lacking public fact-based confirmation at this time.",

      "searchResults": "The claim that \"Senate Republicans stole a Supreme Court Justice\" likely refers to controversial actions by Senate Republicans during the confirmation process of a Supreme Court Justice, especially relating to the blocking or rushing of nominations. Historically, Supreme Court nominations require a majority vote in the Senate after a process of committee hearings and debate, which has evolved over time. \n\nKey points about the process relevant to this claim include:\n\n- The Constitution mandates the President to nominate Supreme Court Justices with the \"Advice and Consent\" of the Senate, allowing the Senate to confirm by a simple majority vote[1][2][3][4].\n- Traditionally, many nominees were confirmed by voice vote or unanimous consent, representing bipartisanship and agreement across parties. Over time, this practice has shifted, becoming more contentious and partisan[1].\n- The Senate used to require 60 votes to end debate (cloture) on Supreme Court nominees, but in 2017, Senate Republicans changed the rules (often called the \"nuclear option\") to require only a simple majority (51 votes) for cloture and confirmation, bypassing the previous supermajority consensus requirement[3].\n- Related to \"stealing\" a justice, the most cited example is Senate Republicans' refusal in 2016 to hold hearings for President Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland, claiming it was too close to the presidential election, then quickly confirming President Trump's nominee Neil Gorsuch in 2017 using the nuclear option[1].\n- Senate Democrats have similarly shortened or accelerated confirmation processes under Republican presidencies, as referenced in the quoted tweet about abandoning the traditional \"gold standard\" of advice and consent by Democrats[Quoted].\n\nThus, while the Senate Republicans altered long-standing norms by using partisan tactics (blocking Garland, changing cloture rules), the term \"stole a Supreme Court Justice\" is a political characterization reflecting disagreement with those tactics rather than a violation of constitutional procedure. The Senate's power to confirm justices lies in a political process governed by its own rules, which have shifted toward partisanship in recent years.\n\nIn short, Senate Republicans fundamentally changed the process by blocking a nominee and changing cloture rules to confirm justices with a simple majority instead of broad consensus, which critics describe as \"stealing\" a Justice, but it remains within the Senate’s constitutional confirmation authority[1][3]. The quoted tweet focuses on Democrats also abandoning consensus norms in recent confirmations.",

While **banks are obliged to report withdrawals of over €3,000 to the tax agency and may ask for advance notice to ensure cash availability, the notification is not mandatory from individuals to the tax agency**[2].\n- **Some banks in Spain may ask customers for advance notice for operational reasons** (e.g., making sure they have enough cash on hand), but this is not a government or legal requirement and is not punishable by a €150,000 fine[2].\n- **Penalties for not giving advance notice to the tax authorities before such a withdrawal do not exist**, according to both the Ministry of Finance and independent fact checks[2].\n\nThere are, however, **reporting obligations for banks regarding large cash movements to help combat money laundering and tax evasion**. Recent news also notes **stricter rules around documentation and requests for information for withdrawals over €3,000**, but the largest fines discussed apply only in severe cases of non-compliance usually related to criminal activities, money laundering, or the structure of multiple suspicious transactions[1]. Most standard fines start much lower (from €600 upwards, depending on severity)[1].\n\nIn summary, **the image exaggerates and misrepresents the current legal requirements in Spain regarding personal bank withdrawals**. The Ministry of Finance and several financial reporting outlets have confirmed you do not need government permission, nor is there an automatic fine up to €150,000 for withdrawing your own funds[1][2].",

      "searchResults": "The claim that political aggression and violence against innocent people all come from the left is not supported by recent research. Data indicate that right-wing extremists have been responsible for significantly more politically motivated murders in the United States than left-wing extremists. For example, since 1975, left-wing terrorists accounted for only about 2% of politically motivated murders, whereas right-wing terrorists accounted for 11%, and Islamist terrorists were responsible for 87% of these murders[2]. When excluding the 9/11 attacks, right-wing violence dominates politically motivated murders, with left-wing violence still much lower in comparison[2].\n\nA comprehensive study comparing left-wing, right-wing, and Islamist political violence found that left-wing actors are generally less likely to engage in violence than right-wing or Islamist extremists in the U.S. context[1]. Therefore, political violence is not predominantly from the left as the claim states.\n\nRegarding terminology such as \"Nazi,\" it is used in modern political discourse often as a pejorative by some on the left to criticize perceived authoritarianism or extreme right-wing views, but this is more a rhetorical device than a direct comparison to historical Nazis.\n\nIn summary, credible research indicates that politically motivated violence in the U.S. and globally has been more associated with right-wing and Islamist extremists than with the left, contradicting the assertion that aggression and violence are solely from the left[1][2].",

      "searchResults": "The claim that statistically a \"conservative\" person is probably responsible for killing Charlie aligns with recent data showing that far-right extremists (often associated with right-wing or conservative ideologies) have committed the majority of extremist-related murders in the U.S. in recent years. Specifically, in 2024, *all* documented extremist-related killings (13 in total) were connected to far-right extremism, including white supremacists and anti-government extremists[1]. Over the previous decade, right-wing extremists were responsible for about 75% of murders committed by political extremists, according to ADL data cited in the query and consistent with trends observed by other research.\n\nFurther details from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) report indicate that violent extremist-related murders have declined recently, but the continuing dominance of far-right actors in extremist killings remains a serious concern[1]. Related studies also show that right-wing extremists are more likely to commit lethal acts of terror domestically than left-wing extremists, though Islamist extremists globally tend to result in higher fatalities per attack[3].\n\nTherefore, based on current available statistics about politically motivated killings in the U.S., a perpetrator linked to a far-right or conservative extremist ideology is statistically the most likely to have committed such a murder, supporting the claim in the query. However, it is important to distinguish \"far-right extremist\" from all conservatives generally, as not all conservatives or right-wing individuals engage in extremist violence.\n\n**Key points:**\n\n- In 2024, *100%* of extremist-related murders were by far-right extremists (including white supremacists and anti-government extremists)[1].\n- About 75% of extremist political murders over the past decade were committed by right-wing extremists[1].\n- Right-wing extremist violence in the U.S. is a significant domestic terrorism concern relative to other extremist ideologies, per multiple datasets[3].\n- The term \"conservative\" broadly includes many who do not engage in or support extremist violence; the statistics specifically relate to *far-right extremists* rather than conservatives generally.\n\nThis evidence supports the statistical inference that a politically motivated killer like \"Charlie\" is more likely to have far-right extremist ties. \n\n[1] https://www.waterisac.org/portal/tlpclear-adl-report-%E2%80%93-murder-and-extremism-united-states-2024  \n[3] https://ccjs.umd.edu/feature/umd-led-study-shows-disparities-violence-among-extremist-groups",

      "searchResults": "Liberty University has faced multiple allegations and lawsuits claiming that it has expelled or disciplined female students who reported being raped, based on violations of its moral code, the \"Liberty Way,\" particularly related to premarital sex or alcohol use. These claims include cases where victims were sanctioned or forced to apologize to perpetrators, suggesting the university prioritized enforcing its moral standards over supporting survivors of sexual assault[1][2].\n\nHowever, Liberty University officially states that it complies with Title IX regulations and has an amnesty policy designed to protect students from punishment for violations of the Liberty Way when those violations are disclosed in the context of reporting sexual misconduct. Their Office of Equity and Compliance’s Amnesty policy explicitly says that students will *not* be disciplined for such violations if they are related to sexual misconduct cases, aiming to encourage students to come forward without fear of repercussions[4].\n\nDespite this stated policy, investigative reports and lawsuits allege many instances where survivors were punished or discouraged from reporting assaults, and some say the university's handling of sexual assault complaints has been inadequate or retraumatizing for survivors, as detailed by Inside Higher Ed and ProPublica. Some survivors have reported being fined or expelled after reporting assaults, reflecting a tension between the university’s public policies and the experiences of some students[1][2].\n\nRegarding the documentary mentioned on Hulu, it relates to this ongoing controversy and is part of investigative journalism highlighting these issues at Liberty University, aiming to expose how the institution's policies have functioned in practice[1][2].\n\nIn summary:\n- There are **allegations and lawsuits** that Liberty University has expelled or disciplined female students who reported rape because such reporting was seen as violating their moral code[1][2].\n- The university officially has an **amnesty policy** that should protect victims from punishment for Liberty Way violations related to sexual assault reports[4].\n- Investigations and survivors’ testimonies indicate that, despite the amnesty policy, in practice students may have been punished, prompting legal challenges and public scrutiny[1][2].\n- The Hulu documentary covers this controversy and survivor stories in detail.\n\nTherefore, while the claim that the university “allegedly expels female students who have been raped” is supported by multiple investigative reports and lawsuits, the university denies systemic wrongdoing and asserts compliance with laws and policies designed to protect survivors[1][2][4].",

The suspect is still at large, and two individuals previously taken into custody were released with no connection to the crime[1][2].\n- **The FBI has released images of a person of interest and requested public assistance, but no names have been released** by any law enforcement agency or major news outlet[2][3].\n- News sources confirm the investigation is ongoing. **Officials explicitly state they are working through leads and collecting evidence, but have not announced the identity of the shooter**[1][2][3].\n\n**Regarding the Soundcloud track and \"4chan intel\":**\n- The claim that \"4chan identified the suspect as Skye Valadez,\" and references to a Soundcloud track titled \"Charlie Kirk Dead at 31,\" are not supported by any mainstream reporting or official statement.\n- The official law enforcement communications urge the public *not* to rely on social media speculation and instead to provide legitimate tips to investigators[2].\n\n**Image Verification:**\n- The images you provided appear to show a Soundcloud profile with a track named \"Charlie Kirk Dead at 31,\" as well as social media content from someone named Skye Valadez. However, there is **no official or credible confirmation connecting this individual to the investigation**, nor is there a mention of this person on any law enforcement or reputable news channels[1][2][3].\n\n**Summary:**  \nAt this time, reports suggesting Skye Valadez has been identified as the Charlie Kirk shooter are **unsubstantiated and contradicted by the most current official sources**, which state the shooter has not been identified and the investigation is ongoing[1][2][3]. Confirming details from unverified forums or social media is premature and potentially misleading.\n\n---\n**Sources:**\n[1] CBS News: Authorities have not identified a suspect and are still seeking information regarding the shooter.\n[2] ABC News: FBI appeals for tips, releases images of person of interest, but does not name anyone.\n[3] Fox News/YouTube: Law enforcement commentary reiterates no public identification of the shooter.",

      "searchResults": "The rifle believed to have been used to assassinate Charlie Kirk was reportedly found with ammunition engraved with transgender and antifascist messages, according to an internal law enforcement bulletin cited by The Wall Street Journal and other sources[1][2]. The rifle, described as an older-model .30 caliber bolt-action, was recovered wrapped in a towel near the shooting site at Utah Valley University[1][2][3]. However, a senior law enforcement official cautioned that the report about the engravings had not yet been verified by Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) analysts and could be subject to misinterpretation amid the ongoing investigation[1].\n\nAdditional available details describe the shooter as a person of college age who arrived on campus shortly before the attack and fled after shooting Kirk from a roof, with physical evidence like footwear, palm, and forearm prints collected by investigators[2][4]. The FBI continues to search for the suspect and urges the public to provide information[4].\n\nIn summary, while multiple credible news outlets report engraved ammunition with transgender and antifascist phrases found with the murder weapon, official forensic confirmation of the engravings remains pending as of the latest updates[1][2][3].",

      "searchResults": "The claim that \"The Democrat party is the party of political violence\" and that if they’re not directly responsible, they are \"celebrating it\" is an oversimplification and misleading. Political violence in the United States has occurred across the political spectrum, with violence and threats targeting both Democrats and Republicans, and there is no credible evidence showing one party solely responsible or universally celebrating violence.\n\nKey points from recent sources include:\n\n- There have been violent attacks against Democratic figures, such as the shooting of Democratic state legislators in Minnesota in 2023 by a right-wing attacker with a hit list targeting Democrats[1]. In 2022, a man attempted to assassinate conservative Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh due to anger over a leaked Supreme Court abortion ruling; he was not aligned with Democrats[3]. Nancy Pelosi’s husband was attacked by an intruder with apparent anti-Democratic motives[3][5]. These incidents demonstrate violence targeting Democrats from various extremist individuals, not violence committed by or endorsed by the party.\n\n- Similarly, right-wing violence has occurred, including the 2017 shooting of Republican lawmakers by a left-wing extremist in Alexandria, Virginia[5]. Political offices of both parties have been targeted by arson and shootings[5]. Attacks and violent rhetoric have come from individuals with extremist views on both sides[4][5].\n\n- Some commentary and opinion sources allege Democratic encouragement or celebration of violence, particularly pointing to protests around the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision and rhetoric by some Democratic figures[2][4]. However, these are opinion pieces rather than evidence that the party as a whole commits or celebrates violence officially.\n\n- Political violence in the current era is complex and cannot easily be attributed to a single party. Both parties and their supporters have been victims and occasionally perpetrators, with a range of extremist individuals on both sides responsible for violent acts[1][3][5].\n\nIn summary, no authoritative, fact-based source confirms that the Democratic Party as an organization is the party of political violence or celebrates it. Violence is committed by individuals across the political spectrum, and both Democratic and Republican figures have been victims of political violence. Assertions that one party bears sole responsibility are not supported by the evidence.  \n\nSources:  \n[1] ABC News — Trump condemns political violence, but attacks have targeted Democrats  \n[2] Chronicles (opinion) — Critical of Democrats, but opinion rather than verified fact  \n[3] Sky News — Attacks and attempted assassinations affecting both sides  \n[4] The Daily BS (opinion) — Claims about Democratic violence, mixed with opinion  \n[5] Anadolu Agency — Political violence targets both parties and offices  \n[6] New English Review (opinion) — Historical claims, not recent evidence  \n[7] Northeastern University — Recent analysis of political violence increasing generally",
