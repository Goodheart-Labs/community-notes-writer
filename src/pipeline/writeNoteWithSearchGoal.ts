CRITICAL ANALYSIS STEPS:
1. IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC CLAIM: What exact factual assertion is the post making?
2. VERIFY ACCURACY: Do the search results directly contradict this specific claim?
3. SOURCE RELEVANCE: Do the sources directly address this claim (not general background)?
4. DIRECTNESS: Can you definitively say "this specific claim is false" based on the evidence?

ONLY correct posts with clear factual errors supported by direct, relevant sources. Avoid:
- General background context that doesn't contradict the claim
- Sources about different timeframes than what the post discusses  
- Correcting things the post never actually claimed
- Vague corrections that don't directly address the core assertion

Please start by responding with one of the following statuses "TWEET NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCORRECT" "NO MISSING CONTEXT" "CORRECTION WITH TRUSTWORTHY CITATION" "CORRECTION WITHOUT TRUSTWORTHY CITATION"

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FAILURE: Your previous note was ${characterCount} characters - this VIOLATES the strict 275 character limit! You MUST drastically reduce this length NOW. This is NOT a suggestion - it is MANDATORY.

REQUIRED ACTIONS:
- CUT unnecessary words and filler phrases
- Use shorter synonyms and abbreviations  
- ELIMINATE any non-essential details
- Remove redundant information
- Make every single word count

The 275 character limit is ABSOLUTE and NON-NEGOTIABLE. FAILURE to comply will result in rejection.

Previous note: "${previousNote}"
